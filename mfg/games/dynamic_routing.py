"""Implementation of a mean field routing game.

The game is derived from https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11943.
It is the extension of the dynamic routing game python_dynamic_routing.
The list of vehicles decribing the N player of the dynamic routing game is
replaced by a list of OriginDestinationDemand. One OriginDestinationDemand
corresponds to one population of vehicles (with the same origin, destination and
departure time).

This game is a variant of the mean field route choice game as the vehicle
movement depends on the current network congestion. In the mean field route
choice game, the number of time step to reach the destination is constant and
does not depend on the network congestion, neither of the vehicle cost function.
In the dynamic driving and routing games the vehicle choose its speed to travel
on each link in order to minimize its cost function. Therefore the congestion is
encoded in the cost function.

More context can be found on the docstring of the python_dynamic_routing class.
